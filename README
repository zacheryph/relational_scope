RelationalScope
===============

This plugin makes it possible to filter a specific model using the
named_scope's of one of its relations.  This prevents making duplicate
named_scopes in multiple models.


Example
=======

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
	belongs_to :author

	has_relational_scope :author, :prefix => 'a'
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	named_scope :admins, :conditions => {:admin => true}
end

In your Controller you can go:

@posts = Post.a_admins

This will fetch all and only posts where the author is an admin.

Without the :prefix option this would be called as Post.author_admins
